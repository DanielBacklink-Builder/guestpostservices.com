# Portfolio — Static Template

This is a simple responsive static portfolio template (HTML/CSS/JS). Copy the files to a folder and open `index.html` in your browser to preview.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styling
- `script.js` — minimal interactions
- `resume.pdf` — (optional) add your resume file
- Images — replace placeholder images in `projects` with real screenshots

Customize:
- Replace "Your Name", bio, project titles/descriptions/links, email, and social links.
- Replace placeholder images (currently via placeholder.com) with real screenshots in the `img` tags.
- Adjust colors in `styles.css` root variables.

Contact form:
- The form uses a simple `mailto:` action by default (opens the email client).
- To use a hosted contact form, use Formspree, Netlify Forms, or a backend endpoint and update the form `action` and method accordingly.

Deploy:
- GitHub Pages: push the repo and enable Pages from the repo settings (use `main` branch / root).
- Netlify / Vercel: Connect the repository and deploy (recommended for HTTPS and continuous deploys).

Need help:
- If you want a React or Next.js version, or Tailwind-based styling, tell me which framework and I’ll generate it.
- If you send your name, bio, projects, and links, I’ll fill the template with your real content and produce a ready repo structure.
